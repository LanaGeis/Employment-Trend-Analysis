    "While connecting to API and cleaning/formating ONET occupation data, I performed the following steps:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "#### **Initial Setup and Connection Testing:**\n",
    "- Configured ONET Web Services connection using official sample code\n",
    "- Implemented secure credential management using environment variables\n",
    "- Tested API connection\n",
    "- Validated response status and error handling\n",
    "- Added rate limiting to respect API constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Processing Setup and SOC Code formatting:**\n",
    "- Loaded the Growing_Declining_SOC.scv file with occupational data\n",
    "- Implemented SOC code formatting function for ONET compatibility\n",
    "- Validated and saved formatted codes to Growing_Declining_ONET_SOC.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **ONET occupation data cleaning and formating steps to occupation_details.json file:**\n",
    "- Implemented fuzzy matching search for occupation titles\n",
    "- Queried ONET API for each occupation with formatted SOC codes and scored and ranked matches\n",
    "- Collected occupation data and saved results in occupation_details.json\n",
    "- Normalized json data using panda\n",
    "- Add columns from modified growing_declining.csv and saved results in occupation_details_upd.json<br>\n",
    "*In occupation_details.json:*\n",
    "- Replaced headers\n",
    "- Found and removed duplicates\n",
    "- Checked for missing values, empty strings and whitespaces in all columns\n",
    "- Removed colum 'job_family' with all values missing\n",
    "- Reordered columns\n",
    "- Saved the cleaned file to the output folder for loading into SQL DB in Milestone 5\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Ethical Implications:**\n",
    "All data came from public sources like BLS and O*NET, keeping it legal and ethical for research use.<br>\n",
    "Growth categories and metrics were clearly labeled to avoid confusion around workforce trends.<br>\n",
    "Some bias may come from assumptions during fuzzy matching and cleaning steps.<br>\n",
    "To help with that, I used multiple sources and documented the process.<br>\n",
    "The project doesn't make firm predictions about AI's impact but stays transparent and notes its limits.<br>\n"
